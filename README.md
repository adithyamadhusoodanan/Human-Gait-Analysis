# Gait Analysis And Correction

This repository contains the code and dataset for the project Gait Analysis and Correction.

There are two main approach being followed

## Classical Algorithms

Various algorithms were compared and also hyper parameters optimisized for classification models like Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighours etc.

##Time Series Classification

The dataset was converted top time series data by performing sliding window segmentation. Then various LSTM and CNN models were implemented and trained on the datstet and there performance compared.
